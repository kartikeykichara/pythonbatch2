    "# Why {1: 'a', True: 'b'} becomes {1: 'b'}\n",
    "# In Python, dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys. When you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# d = {1: 'a', True: 'b'}\n",
    "# print(d)  # Output: {1: 'b'}\n",
    "# Here’s what happens behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Points:\n",
    "# 1 and True are considered the same key in a dictionary because:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, 1 == True evaluates to True (they are \"equal\" in value).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary keys are hashed, and both 1 and True hash to the same value:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# print(hash(1))      # Output: 1\n",
    "# print(hash(True))   # Output: 1\n",
    "# Key Uniqueness Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "# When a dictionary encounters two keys that are \"equal\" (like 1 and True), it keeps the last key-value pair and discards the earlier one.\n",
    "\n",
    "# So True: 'b' overwrites 1: 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step-by-Step Execution:\n",
    "# Python processes the first key-value pair: 1: 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When it encounters True: 'b', it checks if True is already a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since 1 == True and hash(1) == hash(True), Python treats them as the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The dictionary replaces 1: 'a' with True: 'b'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finally, Python displays 1: 'b' (not True: 'b') because:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1 and True are equal, but 1 was the first literal used in the dictionary definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Internally, Python retains the first key's literal representation for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Proof of Concept:\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# d = {True: 'b', 1: 'a'}\n",
    "# print(d)  # Output: {True: 'a'} (now True is kept as the key)\n",
    "# Here, True: 'b' is overwritten by 1: 'a', but the dictionary displays True because it appeared first.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why This Behavior?\n",
    "# Python’s dictionary implementation optimizes for fast lookups using hash values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# If two keys have the same hash and are equal (==), they are treated as identical keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is why False and 0 also collide:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# d = {False: 'no', 0: 'zero'}\n",
    "# print(d)  # Output: {False: 'zero'}\n",
    "# Key Takeaways:\n",
    "# Dictionary keys must be unique (based on == and hash()).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1 and True are treated as the same key, as are 0 and False.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The last duplicate key's value wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The dictionary displays the first key's literal form for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to Avoid This Pitfall:\n",
    "# Use keys with distinct values/hashes (e.g., 1 and 2 instead of 1 and True).\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you need to distinguish 1 and True, use different data structures (e.g., tuples as keys):\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# d = {(1, 'int'): 'a', (True, 'bool'): 'b'}\n",
    "# print(d)  # Output: {(1, 'int'): 'a', (True, 'bool'): 'b'}\n",
    "# Final Answer:\n",
    "# The output is {1: 'b'} because:"
